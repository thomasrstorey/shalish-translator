# shavian-translator
Web app to translate from English to the (fictional) Shavian language.

## Overview

The seed of this little toy is an idea to make a "translator that lies". I thought there was something mildly interesting about that. So I started looking for more meaningful ways for my translator to lie. Hashing is a kind of translating, but a translation from communication to obfuscation. The current relationship of the average internet user to the idea of cryptography is fraught. Equally important to freedom and control of information. It's the technology upon which the entire networked system of (dis)trust depends. So an app that translates, in a very normative-looking way, english input into a unique output generated through converting the 256 bit result of the SHA256 algorithm to a string of 8 characters, seems a poetically worthwhile thing to do. Especially since it is completely silly and useless. :)
